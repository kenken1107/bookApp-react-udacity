# MyReads Project

## Overview

In the MyReads project, I created a bookshelf app that allows the user to select and categorize books they have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that I used to persist information as the user interacts with the application.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## How to run the project

To run the project, download or clone the repository in your computer:

    $ git clone https://github.com/kenken1107/bookApp-react-udacity.git

and follow the instructions below.

In the repository folder:

- install all project dependencies with

        npm install

- start the development server with

        npm start

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

- [`getAll`](#getall)
- [`update`](#update)
- [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll();
```

- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
- This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf);
```

- book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
- shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]
- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query);
```

- query: `<String>`
- Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
- These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [**SEARCH_TERMS.md**](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the **only terms** that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
